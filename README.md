# AngularAzureB2C

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.

The purpose for this project is to integrate Azure B2C and authenticate user access to a simple Angular 6 page. 
It has been adapted from https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/active-directory-b2c-javascript-angular2-4-spa/ which has not been updated for a while. 

The idea is to demonstrate the ease with which such an integration can be incorporated within the app with minimal set up after a base angular-cli project has been initiated.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
